=head1 NAME

X11::XCB - perl bindings for libxcb

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use X11::XCB::Connection;
  my $x = X11::XCB::Connection->new;

  my $window = $x->root->create_child(
    class => X11::XCB::WINDOW_CLASS_INPUT_OUTPUT(),
    rect => [0, 0, 200, 200],
    background_color => '#FF00FF',
  );

  $window->map;
  print "Press Enter to continue\n";
  <>;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These bindings wrap libxcb (a C library to speak with X11, in many cases better
than Xlib in many aspects) and provide a nice object oriented interface to its
methods (using Mouse).

Please note that its aim is B<NOT> to provide yet another toolkit for creating
graphical applications. It is a low-level method of communicating with X11. Use
cases include testcases for all kinds of X11 applications, implementing really
simple applications which do not require an graphical toolkit (such as GTK, QT,
etc.) or command-line utilities which communicate with X11.

B<WARNING>: X11::XCB is in a rather early stage and thus API breaks may happen
in future versions. It is not yet widely used.
